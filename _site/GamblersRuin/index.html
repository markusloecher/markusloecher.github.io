<h2 id="random-walks">Random Walks</h2>

<p>Suppose we start with <em>n</em> dollars, and make a sequence of bets. For each
bet, we win 1 dollar with probability <em>p</em>, and lose 1 dollar with
probability 1 − <em>p</em>. We quit if either we go broke, in which case we
lose, or when we reach <em>T</em> = <em>n</em> + <em>m</em> dollars, that is, when we win <em>m</em>
dollars. For example, in Roulette, <em>p</em> = 18/38 = 9/19 ∼ 0.473. If
<em>n</em> = 100 dollars, and <em>m</em> = 100 dollars, then <em>T</em> = 200 dollars. What
are the odds we win 100 dollars before losing 100 dollars? Most folks
would think that since 0.473 ∼ 0.5, the odds are not so bad. In fact, as
we will see, we win before we lose with probability at most 1/37649!</p>

<h2 id="boundary-crossing">Boundary Crossing</h2>

<p>This random walk is a special type of random walk where moves are
independent of the past. If <em>p</em> = 1/2, the random walk is unbiased and
is called a .For <em>p</em> ≠ 1/2, the random walk is biased (). If the walk
hits a boundary (0 or <em>n</em> + <em>m</em>), then we stop playing.</p>

<h2 id="probability-to-win">Probability to win</h2>

<p>Let’s figure out the probability that we gain m before losing n. To set
things up formally, let <em>W</em> be the event we hit <em>T</em> before we hit 0,
where <em>T</em> = <em>n</em> + <em>m</em>. Let <em>D</em><sub><em>t</em></sub> be a random variable that
denotes the number of dollars we have at time step <em>t</em>. Let
<em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = ℙ(<em>W</em>|<em>D</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>n</em>) be the probability we
get <em>T</em> before we go broke, given that we start with <em>n</em> dollars. Our
question then, is what is <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> ? We’re going to use a
recursive approach.
<em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>p</em> ⋅ <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub> + (1 − <em>p</em>) ⋅ <em>P</em><sub><em>n</em> − 1</sub>,  for 0 &lt; <em>n</em> &lt; <em>T</em></p>

<p>This last expression is even independent of n, and exponentially small
in m.</p>

<h2 id="intuition-off-">Intuition off ?</h2>

<p>Why does this seem to run against our intuition ? Normally we would
think that the probability of winning 100 dollars before losing 200
dollars is better than winning 10 before losing 10, i.e., that the ratio
is what matters. In fact, the ratio is what matters if the game is fair,
i.e., if <em>p</em> = 1/2. In that case, we simply have
<em>P</em><sub><em>n</em></sub> = <em>n</em>/(<em>n</em> + <em>m</em>) = <em>n</em>/<em>T</em>
In this case, if <em>n</em> = 200 and <em>m</em> = 100, we have Pr(Win)=200/300=2/3.
On the other hand, if <em>n</em> = 10 and <em>m</em> = 10, then Pr(Win)=10/20=1/2.
Thus, actually, now we are more likely to win in the first case!</p>

<p>So the trouble is that our intuition tells us that if the game is almost
fair, then we expect the results to be almost the same as if the game
were fair. It turns out this is not the case!</p>
