**Washington, D.C. – April 1, 2025** – In an unprecedented move blending corporate ambition with federal policy, **Elon Musk**, as head of the newly created **Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)**, has reportedly **convinced the U.S. government to mandate that all federal employees trade in their gas-powered vehicles for Teslas**.  

The shocking decision, dubbed the **"Full Self-Driving Federal Initiative" (FSDFI)**, allegedly emerged from a **midnight Twitter Spaces discussion between Musk and the White House**, during which the billionaire CEO reportedly quipped, *“If we’re serious about the future, it’s time to delete gas.”* Within hours, an executive order draft was leaked, sparking chaos across government agencies.  

Employees will reportedly **receive a Tesla Model 3 at a ‘special discount’—payable exclusively in Dogecoin**. In a follow-up tweet, Musk added, *“DOGE is now legal tender for all federal transactions. Don’t fight the meme, embrace it.”*  

While the White House has yet to confirm the policy, sources claim that **Secret Service agents are already swapping out their Suburbans for Cybertrucks** and that the Pentagon is “strongly considering” Model Xs as troop carriers.
