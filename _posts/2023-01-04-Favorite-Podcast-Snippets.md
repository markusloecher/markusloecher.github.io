Note:

- Every bullet below provides (first) a direct link to the audio excerpt
  (on github) as well as a link to the original episode on
  freakonomics.com with time information
- Until [Airr](https://www.airr.io/) becomes available for Android I am
  going to have to manually extract passages from podcasts that I really
  like, sigh. Maybe the required substantial manual work acts as a
  filter for not overloading this page.

  (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/advertising-part-2/> 07:20-09:47),
  **careful, you will laugh out loud!**

- [Tim Wong on AI subsidized by the advertising

  (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/math-curriculum/> 25:01-27:32)

### People I (Mostly) Admire

- [Kerwin Charles on Public
  Speaking](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-2021-01-02-15h08m18s-Kerwin%20Charles_%20“One%20Does%20Not%20Know%20Where%20an%20Insight%20Will%20Come%20From”-.mp3)  
  (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-kerwin-charles/> 05:45-07:27)

The following semi serious quotes are from a bonus episode introducing
the new podcast [People I (Mostly)
Admire](https://freakonomics.com/pima/) which can actually be
[watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbGMWZYuCt4&feature=youtu.be)
instead of just listened to.

- Steven Levitt on
  - [avoiding time commitments
    :)](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-Steve%20Levitt_I'm%20Not%20as%20Childlike%20as%20I'd%20Like%20to%20Be-0125-0156.mp3)  
    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-bonus-steve-levitt/> 01:25 -
    01:56)
  - [the folly of getting a PhD or writing
    books](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-Steve%20Levitt_I'm%20Not%20as%20Childlike%20as%20I'd%20Like%20to%20Be-0338-0520.mp3)  
    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-bonus-steve-levitt/> 03:38 -
    05:20)  
    I actually do not agree with this extremely oversimplified
    -borderline pretentious- view whose main purpose seems to want to
    support Levitt’s “iconoclastic” status; but I like it as a thought
    provoking exercise.

#### Life Advice

- Dan Gilbert on
  - [putting your entire self into things turns it into
    joy](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/pima-Gilbert-Turning-Work-into-Play-1816-2035.mp3)  
    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/turning-work-into-play/> 18:16 -
    20:35)
  - [Say No more often, publish
    less](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/pima-Gilbert-Turning-Work-into-Play-2015-2333.mp3)  
    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/turning-work-into-play/> 20:15 -
    23:33)
  - [If Money Doesn’t Make You Happy Then You Probably Aren’t Spending
    It
    Right.](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/pima-Gilbert-Turning-Work-into-Play-2341-2602.mp3)  
    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/turning-work-into-play/> 23:41 -
    26:02) I only buy this advice 10%, it is just too simplistic. “…use
    this money to have a weekly party for my friends.” is a bit too
    close to *The Great Gatsby*.

### No Stupid Questions

- [The deeper reasons for
  boredom](https://stitcher-injected.simplecastaudio.com/fab071f4-583a-498c-a495-58f7d4c71242/episodes/74cb1c85-2447-4b58-9511-72e0d7b46a1b/audio/128/default.mp3/default.mp3_ywr3ahjkcgo_d208963988d3e504176555c052e14c9c_36667196.mp3?awCollectionId=fab071f4-583a-498c-a495-58f7d4c71242&awEpisodeId=74cb1c85-2447-4b58-9511-72e0d7b46a1b&hash_redirect=1&x-total-bytes=36667196&x-ais-classified=unclassified&listeningSessionID=0CD_382_348__d7c91a9df0722ff64865717a2d08974bc2e7d23f)
