Note:

- Every bullet below provides (first) a direct link to the audio excerpt
  (on github) as well as a link to the original episode on
  freakonomics.com with time information
- Until [Airr](https://www.airr.io/) becomes available for Android I am
  going to have to manually extract passages from podcasts that I really
  like, sigh. Maybe the required substantial manual work acts as a
  filter for not overloading this page.

### People I (Mostly) Admire

- [Kerwin Charles on Public
  Speaking](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-2021-01-02-15h08m18s-Kerwin%20Charles_%20“One%20Does%20Not%20Know%20Where%20an%20Insight%20Will%20Come%20From”-.mp3)  
  (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-kerwin-charles/> 05:45-07:27)

The following semi serious quotes are from a bonus episode introducing
the new podcast [People I (Mostly)
Admire](https://freakonomics.com/pima/) which can actually be
[watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbGMWZYuCt4&feature=youtu.be)
instead of just listened to.

- Steven Levitt on
  - [avoiding time commitments
    :)](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-Steve%20Levitt_I'm%20Not%20as%20Childlike%20as%20I'd%20Like%20to%20Be-0125-0156.mp3)

    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-bonus-steve-levitt/> 03:38 -
    05:20)  
    I actually do not agree with this extremely oversimplified
    -borderline pretentious- view whose main purpose seems to want to
    support Levitt’s “iconoclastic” status; but I like it as a thought
    provoking exercise.

#### Life Advice

- Dan Gilbert on
  - [putting your entire self into things turns it into
    joy](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/pima-Gilbert-Turning-Work-into-Play-1816-2035.mp3)  
    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/turning-work-into-play/> 18:16 -

    less](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/pima-Gilbert-Turning-Work-into-Play-2015-2333.mp3)

    23:33)
  - [If Money Doesn’t Make You Happy Then You Probably Aren’t Spending
    It
    Right.](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/pima-Gilbert-Turning-Work-into-Play-2341-2602.mp3)  
    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/turning-work-into-play/> 23:41 -
    26:02) I only buy this advice 10%, it is just too simplistic. “…use
    this money to have a weekly party for my friends.” is a bit too
    close to *The Great Gatsby*.

### “Fairness” debate running out of control

Man, these increasingly extreme definitions of “racism” are so absurd; I
find it dangerous that they are being disseminated by established
academics who also communicate well, appear convincing/smart and are
convinced/inspired by their ideas.

Listen in for 5 minutes (although it’s worth listening to the whole
podcast because you’ll lose faith):
<https://open.spotify.com/episode/1QxvMbmP9JZ274jge4Er6V?si=RfH3VnLjQRqKRHU-_lHGuA&t=821>

<https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/facebook-abandons-facial-recognition-should-everyone-else-follow-suit-luke-stark/>

Absolute highlights: “all facial recognition is fundamentally racist”
“Does that extend to like face unlock for your phone? Is that
fundamentally racist?” “I think it is. Because just by the act of decide
deciding to put numbers to your face, right? … these facial unlock
systems are making a kind of judgement about what a face is?”

“textbook definition of racism: using kind of external physical
quantification, physical physical features and making judgments about an
individual based on those features”
