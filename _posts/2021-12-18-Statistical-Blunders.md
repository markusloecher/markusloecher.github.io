### Excessive Mortality due to vaccination

It is bad enough that sensational tabloids spread BS “data summaries”
and intentionally stir doubt and fear in the middle of a raging
pandemic:

But it is embarrassing/inexcusable and downright shameful that a
self-proclaimed statistical authorities ([Prof. Dr. Rolf
Steyer](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O4_wXoQAAAAJ&hl=de)
and [Dr. Georg Kappler](http://g-kappler.de/)) backed by titles from the
University of Jena and LMU Munich reveal a dangerous level of
incompetence which should immediately preclude them from advising
unsuspecting politicians:

On the upside, thank you Prof. Steyer for providing us lecturers with
such a humorous and deterring statistical blunder which never fails to
amuse my 1st semester students during the “correlation is not causation”
discussion. Quite ironic that Dr. Steyer claims to specialize in
[causality](http://www.causal-effects.de/)!
