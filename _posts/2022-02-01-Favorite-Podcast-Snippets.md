    excerpt (on github) as well as a link to the original episode on
    freakonomics.com with time information
-   Until [Airr](https://www.airr.io/) becomes available for Android I
    am going to have to manually extract passages from podcasts that I
    really like, sigh. Maybe the required substantial manual work acts
    as a filter for not overloading this page.

### People I (Mostly) Admire

-   [Kerwin Charles on Public

    (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-kerwin-charles/>
    05:45-07:27)

The following semi serious quotes are from a bonus episode introducing
the new podcast [People I (Mostly)
Admire](https://freakonomics.com/pima/) which can actually be
[watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbGMWZYuCt4&feature=youtu.be)
instead of just listened to.

    -   [avoiding time commitments
        :)](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-Steve%20Levitt_I'm%20Not%20as%20Childlike%20as%20I'd%20Like%20to%20Be-0125-0156.mp3)  
        (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-bonus-steve-levitt/>

    -   [the folly of getting a PhD or writing
        books](/assets/podcasts/excerpts/vlc-record-Steve%20Levitt_I'm%20Not%20as%20Childlike%20as%20I'd%20Like%20to%20Be-0338-0520.mp3)  
        (<https://freakonomics.com/podcast/pima-bonus-steve-levitt/>
        03:38 - 05:20)  
        I actually do not agree with this extremely oversimplified
        -borderline pretentious- view whose main purpose seems to want
        to support Levitt’s “iconoclastic” status; but I like it as a
        thought provoking exercise.
