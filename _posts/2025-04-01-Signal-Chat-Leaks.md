================

**Geneva ‚Äì April 1, 2025** ‚Äì In what intelligence officials are calling **‚Äúthe most poorly secured secret chat in history,‚Äù** a leaked Signal group discussion on military operations in Yemen has **shockingly revealed Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as active participants.**  

The **chat group, titled ‚Äúüî•TOP SECRET STRATEGYüî•,‚Äù** was allegedly discovered after an **unnamed intern at a Western intelligence agency** stumbled upon a **screenshot posted on Reddit**. Sources confirm that **Putin‚Äôs username was ‚ÄúVladislav_the_Strategist‚Äù**, while Kim Jong Un **opted for ‚ÄúSupreme_Leader69‚Äù**.  

Transcripts of the chat reveal **highly sensitive discussions** on troop movements, weapons logistics, and‚Äîconfusingly‚Äî**debates over which emoji best represents geopolitical dominance**. At one point, Kim allegedly sent a **GIF of Dennis Rodman dunking**, to which Putin responded with a thumbs-up.  

> *"We have intercepted a lot over the years, but world leaders casually discussing war strategies in a Signal group with read receipts? This is a new level,"* one intelligence officer admitted.  

Following the leak, North Korean state media **denied the allegations**, claiming that Kim does **not use Signal but prefers Telegram stickers.** The Kremlin, meanwhile, issued a brief statement calling the report *‚ÄúWestern propaganda‚Äù* but notably did **not deny the existence of the chat.**  

**More updates to follow‚Ä¶ unless they switch to disappearing messages.**
