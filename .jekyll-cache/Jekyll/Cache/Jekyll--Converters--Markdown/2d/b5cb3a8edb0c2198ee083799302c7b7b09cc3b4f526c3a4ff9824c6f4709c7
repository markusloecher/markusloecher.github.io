<p>The opener to Matthew Walker‚Äôs TED Talk is not exactly what you‚Äôd
expect to hear in a lecture about sleep.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMen who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles
than those who sleep seven hours or more,‚Äù Walker, a UC Berkeley
professor of psychology and neuroscience, told the audience in 2019 at
the popular media organization‚Äôs <a href="https://ted2019.ted.com/">April 15-19
conference</a> in Vancouver, Canada.</p>

<p>That got everyone‚Äôs attention. (Source:

<p>The video of Walker‚Äôs 19-minute ‚ÄúSleep is your superpower‚Äù talk
<strong>received more than 1 million views in the first 72 hours (as of
publication, it‚Äôs up to more than 11,442,588 !)</strong> after it was
posted on the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks">TED Talks website</a>.</p>

<p>I applaud both the outstanding delivery and the main message of his
captivating presentation:</p>

<p>‚ÄúIn 1942, more than 90 percent of Americans were sleeping more than six
hours a night. Today, almost 50 percent of Americans are surviving on a
nightly six hours or less,‚Äù he told Berkeley News. ‚ÄúWe need to reclaim
our right to a full night of sleep, without embarrassment or the stigma
of laziness.‚Äù</p>

<p>However, at about 8:45 into the talk, Matthew walks (no pun intended) on
very thin ice:</p>

<p>‚Äú*I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system, and
that <strong>all it takes is one hour</strong>. Because there is a global experiment
performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and
it's called daylight saving time. <span style="color:red"><strong>Now, in the spring, when we lose
one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart
attacks that following day</strong></span>. In the autumn, when we gain an hour of
sleep, <span style="color:red"><strong>we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks</strong></span>. Isn‚Äôt that
incredible? And you see <strong>exactly the same profile for car crashes, road
traffic accidents, even suicide rates</strong>.‚Äù</p>

<p>Now I tend to be sensitive to gross exaggerations disguised as
‚Äúscientific findings‚Äù and upon hearing of such a ridiculously large
effect of a one-day-one-hour sleep disturbance, all of my alarm bells
went up!</p>

<p>Initially I was super excited about the suggested sample size of 1.6
billion people and wanted to find out how exactly such an incredible
data set could possibly have been gathered. Upon my inquiry, Matthew was
kind enough to point me to the paper, which was the basis for the rather
outrageous claims from above. Luckily, it is an <a href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019">open access
article</a> in the
<em>openheart Journal</em> from 2014.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ted/openheart.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Imagine my grave disappointment to find out that the sample was limited
to 3 years in the state of Michigan and had just 31 cases per day! On
page 4 you find Table 1 which contains the quoted 24% increase and 21%
decrease expressed as relative risk (multipliers 1.24 and 0.79,
respectively):</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ted/image4.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Not mentioned in the talk is that the low sample size leads to rather
wide confidence intervals of [1.05; 1.46] in the spring and [0.62;
0.99] in the fall, which makes for a lot less dramatic possible effects
of 5% upwards and 1% downwards.</p>

<p>More importantly, these changes were not observed on the ‚Äúfollowing day‚Äù
after DST but instead on a Monday and Tuesday, respectively. Why did
Matthew Walker choose these somewhat random days? My guess would be,
because they were the only ones significant at the 5% level, which would
be a classic case of ‚Äú<a href="https://insights.principa.co.za/p-hacking-are-you-guilty-data-fishing">p-value
fishing</a>‚Äù.
If one adjusted for the multiple comparisons (7 days of the week were
tested), the significance disappears altogether. In that light it is no
surprise that the authors ‚Äúlooked for the same signal in more recent
data and it is markedly attenuated and no <strong>longer significant</strong>‚Äù
(private communications with Dr. Gurm).</p>

<p>I would claim that our intuition does not expect a measurable/large
effect of DST on one particular day. In a similar context, Gelman and
Weakliem have pointed out <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27859361">the statistical challenges in estimating
small effects</a>: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ <em>systematic
errors such as overestimation of the magnitudes of small effects can
mislead scientists and, through them, the general public</em>‚Äù.</p>

<p>The brash and reckless overstatement of these modest/insignificant heart
attack numbers really worries me, since they do not come from a tabloid
journalist, YouTuber or casual blogger but from a renowned scientist at
the esteemed University of Berkeley. BTW, I was unable to find any
backing of the statement on ‚Äú<em>exactly the same profile for car crashes,
road traffic accidents, even suicide rates</em>‚Äù in the literature.</p>

<p>What about the click-bait-type opening line of those ‚Äúsignificantly
smaller testicles of men who sleep only five hours‚Äù? Unfortunately,
Prof. Walker did not reveal the corresponding academic sources. The most
likely and relevant paper I found on Google Scholar is a study of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23568594/">the
association between sleep disturbances and semen
quality</a> from 2012:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ted/image5.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This demographically extremely narrow study focusses mainly on semen
quality but also reports that. ‚Äú<em>After control for confounders, sperm
concentration, total sperm count, percent motile spermatozoa, percent
morphologically normal spermatozoa, and testis size were signiÔ¨Åcantly
lower among both men with higher sleep scores and men with lower sleep
scores in comparison with the reference group</em>‚Äù. Table 3 contains the
main results, with testis size highlighted:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ted/image6.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Notice the low sample size in the ‚Äû&gt;50‚Äù category (76 men) and the wide
confidence interval for \(\beta\) ([-2.5; -0.1]) which almost includes
zero<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To give the reader a feel for the magnitude of the effect: The upper end
of the CI should be compared with the median/mean of about 21ml, so
‚Äúsignificant‚Äù really means a reduction of about 0.5 %! It is further noteworthy that an even more
significant reduction of testis size was observed for the extremely good
sleep score of zero<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>.<br />
The authors of this paper did not see how the sleep score &gt;50 could
possibly be translated into ‚ÄúMen who sleep five hours a night‚Äù.</p>

<p>Maybe the answer can be found in this article on <a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.7390">sleep duration and
tesis size</a> in the <em>Journal
of Clinical Sleep Medicine</em>? The main result seems to be a barely
significant observational association based on either 66 or 97
participants, which disappears under resampling. The sample size is too
low to control for other factors (e.g. race/ethnicity, lifestyle,
smoking, alcohol consumption ) than BMI and age and no causality can be
inferred. Furthermore, it is not clear how exactly the sleep duration
was computed from the various scores derived via (i) self-reported
duration, (ii) one-night sleep laboratory, and (iii) a 7-day wrist
actigraphy recording. The many possibilities of creating these scores
leaves the reader somewhat uneasy about reliability of the p-value.<br />
A scatter plot (Fig.2 in the paper) of testicular volume versus sleep
duration shows the ambivalence of model fitting (and suggests that the
sample size was even lower than reported).</p>

<p>What is my takeaway from this rather sobering fact finding mission after
listening to the -at first glance- truly inspiring TED talk?</p>

<p style="color:#2B3856;"><b><ol>
<li>Do not believe outrageous sounding scientific claims, even if they
    are put forth by academic superstars and institutions.</li>

<li>Yes, we should be grateful for the game changing TED "revolution"
    which has gifted the world with high quality talks delivered in a
    uniquely professional and passionate way. At the same time, there is
    the dangerous need to entertain, impress and simplify; possibly at
    the cost of academic integrity and caution.</li>

<li>Given its global reach and immense influence and power, the TED
    institution needs to take responsibility for the content of talks
    delivered under its umbrella. At the very least, there should be a
    routine "fact checking" of the presentations, similar to the ones
    journalists deploy at political debates/speeches.</li>
