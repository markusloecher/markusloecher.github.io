Defining the work "woke" might be the hardest part of this. Jason, everybody has their own. The difficulty with the word is it's changed. Many people have used it in a positive sense in the past. Now it's largely used as a pejorative. 

The way I conceive of it, and the way we're going to use it in this discussion is that it's a worldview which takes as read that progress, particularly on race in America, is impossible, that America's various problems are all systemic or structural, and the solutions to those problems tend to be things like positive discrimination on the basis of race in a very blunt way. 

There's also tendency within this kind of thinking to ascribe people identities as members of particular groups and then categorize those groups as either being victims or oppressors. And that really flattens people's identity and misses a lot of news.
